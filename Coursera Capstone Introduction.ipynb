    "Leveraging the power of Foursquare, access to venue information specific to individual preferences will enhance the user experience. Typically search engines return many results based on certain criteria leading the user to explore many options trying to make a decision. With information specific to areas divided into clusters, only relevant data is considered with information gleaned from customer feedback. This subsetting makes comparisions easy, and helps to provide insight into new areas to explore.  "
